### you
I find myself panting. I just woke up from a bizarre nightmare. a very long one. birds are singing outside. sun is shining through the window. everything is ok, isn't it? why do I smell blood and tears in the air? why is it so unsettling? I can't remember the dream well. there was a global pandemic. we locked ourselves inside. I remember saying goodbye to the beloved vaguely. was there a coup, afterwards? friends were locked inside, again. is there an end to the demons? it seemed like a movie. friends and strangers joining hands against a common foe. except that there wasn't just one foe. it was us against them and I failed to understand who was us and who was them. all the four horsemen of the apocalypse were there. I swear I saw them on their mighty mounts.
